<h1>Nessus速 Essentials Vulnerability Scan</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab project I'll be walking you through the steps on how to conduct a basic vulnerability scan on a virtual Windows速 machine using Nessus Essentials. First we'll configure the target machine in order to access it from a remote network. Then we'll run a non-credentialed scan followed by a credentialed scan to compare the differences.
